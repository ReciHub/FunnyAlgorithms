# 3D Polyhedron Rotation

This Python program uses basic principles of rendering 3D graphics onto a 2D screen to create a rotating polyhedron. It employs the Turtle graphics library to draw the 2D projection of a 3D polyhedron and animates its rotation. The code defines the shape's vertices, edges, and rotation transformations to create the visual effect.

## Usage

1. Run the program.
2. The polyhedron will be displayed, and you'll see it continuously rotating.

## Note

This code is designed for educational purposes and provides a simplified 2D projection of a 3D polyhedron using Turtle graphics. A full 3D representation would require a more advanced graphics library.

# Random Art Generator

## Overview
This Python program is an art generator that creates random art pieces by drawing shapes (rectangles and ellipses) on a canvas. The shapes are filled with random colors, resulting in unique and abstract artworks.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Pillow (PIL) library for image processing

You can install the required library using pip:

"pip install Pillow"

The generated art will be saved as "generated_art.png" in the project directory.

## Customization
You can customize the art generation by modifying the following parameters in the `random_art_generator.py` script:
- `width` and `height`: Set the dimensions of the canvas.
- `num_shapes`: Define the number of shapes to generate.
- Adjust the range for random coordinates and colors to suit your preferences.

Feel free to experiment with different shapes, colors, and parameters to create your own unique art.


Enjoy creating art with the Random Art Generator!

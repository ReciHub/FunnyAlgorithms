A magic square of order n is an arrangement of n^2 numbers, usually distinct integers, in a square, such that the n numbers in all rows, all columns, and both diagonals sum to the same constant. A magic square contains the integers from 1 to n^2.

The constant sum in every row, column and diagonal is called the magic constant or magic sum, M. The magic constant of a normal magic square depends only on n and has the following value:
M = n(n^2+1)/2

FOR EXAMPLE:

Magic Square of size 3
-----------------------
  2   7   6
  9   5   1
  4   3   8
Sum in each row & each column = 3*(3^2+1)/2 = 15


Magic Square of size 5
----------------------
  9   3  22  16  15
  2  21  20  14   8
 25  19  13   7   1
 18  12   6   5  24
 11  10   4  23  17
Sum in each row & each column = 5*(5^2+1)/2 = 65

# Happy Number

# Introduction

A happy number is a number defined by the following process:

 - Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits.
 - Repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1.
 - Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy.

## Do you have some funny algorithm and want to share with the world?

Add your algorithm to this repository so others can find it and enjoy funny moments while reading code. Make sure your code does not violate our Code of Conduct. To add your code, follow these steps:

## Submitting a pull request

1. [Fork](https://github.com/ReciHub/FunnyAlgorithms/fork) and clone the repository
1. Create a new branch: `git checkout -b my-branch-name`
1. Add your code to the folder that matches the section your algorithm belongs to., like if you are uploading a funny sort algorithm add your algorithm inside the "sort" folder
1. Add commentaries in your code to explain what exactly it does, why it is funny and you can comment some things like about the complexity of the code.
1. Push to your fork and [submit a pull request](https://github.com/ReciHub/FunnyAlgorithms/compare)

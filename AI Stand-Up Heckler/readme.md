# AI Stand-Up Heckler

AI Stand-Up Heckler is a Python script that simulates a humorous scenario where an AI heckler interrupts a stand-up comedian's routine with funny heckles. The script generates random heckles from a predefined list and allows the user (the comedian) to tell jokes.

## Usage

1. **Installation**:

   - The script doesn't require any external libraries. You can run it with a standard Python installation.

2. **Running the Program**:

   - Start the program by executing the Python script, and it will guide you through a simulated stand-up comedy routine.

   - The AI heckler will randomly choose heckles to interrupt your jokes.

3. **Customization**:

   - You can customize the list of heckles by modifying the `heckles` list in the code. Add your own humorous remarks or expand the list as you like.

   - You can also adjust the number of jokes the comedian tells during the routine by modifying the loop in the `stand_up_comedy` function.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x (no external libraries required)

## Example

Imagine you want to create a fun and interactive stand-up comedy experience. You run the script, and as you tell your jokes, the AI heckler generates funny heckles, making the performance more amusing.

# Rock Paper Scissors Game

This is a simple Rock Paper Scissors game written in Python language. The game can be played against the computer, where the computer chooses a random move.


## How to Play

To play the game, run the main.py file in your Python environment.

The program will prompt the user to select either rock, paper, or scissors.
After the user selects their choice, the computer will randomly choose one of the three options as well. The program will then determine the winner based on the classic rock paper scissors rules:

- Rock beats scissors
- Scissors beats paper
- Paper beats rock

The program will display the user's choice, the computer's choice, and the outcome of the game (win, lose, or tie).

## Requirements

This program was developed using Python 3. To run the program, you will need to have Python 3 installed on your computer.

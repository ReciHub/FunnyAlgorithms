# Meeting Excuse Generator Algorithm

Do you need a lighthearted and creative excuse to avoid a boring meeting? Look no further! The Meeting Excuse Generator Algorithm provides you with a fun and humorous excuse at the click of a button.

## How it Works

The algorithm randomly selects one of the pre-defined excuses from a list and presents it as your excuse to skip a meeting. These excuses are designed to be funny, creative, and light-hearted, perfect for adding a touch of humor to your day.

## Getting Started

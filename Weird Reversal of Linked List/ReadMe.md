The goal is to reverse groups of k nodes in a linked list, where the value of k is provided as input to the function. If the total number of nodes in the list is not a multiple of k, the remaining nodes at the end should be treated as a separate group and reversed accordingly.

Example:

LinkedList: 1->6->8->12->20
K = 3
Output: 8 6 1 20 12

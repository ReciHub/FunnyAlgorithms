This is a Python script for an "Annoying Alarm Clock." It plays an alarm sound that gets progressively louder over time, and it offers a snooze option.

## Getting Started

To use the Annoying Alarm Clock, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

2. Make sure you have Python installed on your computer. You can download Python from the official website: [Python Downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the script is located.

4. Run the script by executing the following command:


5. The alarm will start, and it will get louder with each passing second.

6. You can stop the alarm at any time by pressing Ctrl+C.

7. If you want to snooze the alarm when it stops, press 's' and the alarm will snooze for the specified snooze time.

## Customization

You can customize the behavior of the alarm by modifying the following variables in the code:

- `alarm_duration`: Set the duration of the alarm in seconds.
- `snooze_time`: Set the snooze time in seconds.

## Operating System Compatibility

This script uses the `winsound` module for sound generation, which is compatible with Windows. If you are using a different operating system, you may need to use a different library for sound playback.

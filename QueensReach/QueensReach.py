# This code takes the size of the n*n board and the initial position of a chess queen as inputs, and returns how many boxes can it cover from the current positions, given that their is just that queen on the whole board
# This code is funny as it wont really help in any real life problem because u cant play with just a single queen with no opponents obstructing XD
# Hopefully my contribution also gets accepted and becomes a part of Hacktober 2022 fest âœ¨

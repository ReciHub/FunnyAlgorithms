# Love Calculator in C++

## Introduction

This is a C++ program that simulates a Love Calculator. It takes two names as input, performs a love compatibility calculation using an arbitrary algorithm, and then displays the result as a percentage. This program does not include graphics, but you can explore adding graphics using a library like SFML or SDL.

## Features

- Input two names and calculate love compatibility.
- Displays the result as a percentage.

## Prerequisites

Before you can run the program, you need to have a C++ development environment set up on your system. You can use tools like `g++` to compile and run C++ programs.

## Customization

You can customize the love compatibility algorithm by modifying the `LoveCalculator.cpp` file. Look for the part of the code that calculates the love score and replace it with your own algorithm.

## Adding Graphics

If you want to add graphics to the Love Calculator, you can explore libraries like SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library) or SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer). These libraries allow you to create graphical user interfaces and add graphics to your program. You may need to refer to the documentation and tutorials for the specific library you choose to implement the graphical interface.

# Search in Rotated Sorted Array

# Introduction

There is an integer array nums sorted in ascending order (with distinct values).

Prior to being passed to the function, nums is possibly rotated at an unknown pivot index k (1 <= k < nums.length) such that the resulting array is [nums[k], nums[k+1], ..., nums[n-1], nums[0], nums[1], ..., nums[k-1]] (0-indexed).<br><br>For example, [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might be rotated at pivot index 3 and become [4,5,6,7,0,1,2].
<br>

Given the array nums after the possible rotation and an integer target, return the index of target if it is in nums, or -1 if it is not in nums.

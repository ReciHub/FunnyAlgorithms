# Sum of Odds in a Triangle.

This is a real fun math challenge I did a couple of weeks ago.

Given the triangle of consecutive odd numbers:
```
1
3     5
7     9    11
13    15    17    19
21    23    25    27    29
31    33    35    37    39    41
...
```

Calculate the row sums of this triangle from the row index (starting at index 1) e.g.:
```
rowSumOddNumbers(1); // 1
rowSumOddNumbers(2); // 3 + 5 = 8
```

Like the Naive Algorithm, Rabin-Karp algorithm also slides the pattern one by one. But unlike the Naive algorithm, Rabin Karp algorithm matches the hash value of the pattern with the hash value of current substring of text, and if the hash values match then only it starts matching individual characters.



calculate hash values for following strings.
1)Pattern itself.
2)All the substrings of the text of length m, that is of the length of pattern string.

Efficient Hashing

Hash at the next shift must be efficiently computable from the current hash value and next character in text or we can say hash(txt[s+1 .. s+m]) must be efficiently computable from hash(txt[s .. s+m-1]) and txt[s+m] i.e., hash(txt[s+1 .. s+m])= rehash(txt[s+m], hash(txt[s .. s+m-1]) and rehash must be O(1) operation.
